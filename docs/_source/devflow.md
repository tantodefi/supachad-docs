# Chad Devflow Reference

This page is the canonical catalog of every script in the Chad sandbox toolchain. Use the **Primary Commands** section below for the 90% case; jump to **Script Catalog** when you need to know exactly what a particular wrapper does.

## Primary Commands

The five commands you'll actually type day-to-day:

```console
# One-time host-side bootstrap (or after major changes):
$ bash scripts/chad-setup.sh chad

# Local sandbox snapshot — fastest pre-destroy/pre-rebuild safety net:
$ nemoclaw chad snapshot create --name before-X

# Snapshot everything and push to chad-state (run before pod resets, after meaningful changes):
$ npm run chad:sync

# Pull state back into a fresh sandbox (auto-runs during chad-setup if no local backup):
$ ssh openshell-chad 'chad-restore-from-github'

# Local triage snapshot — markdown dump for sharing or diffing, no remote calls:
$ ssh openshell-chad 'chad-dump-state' > state-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).md
```

`nemoclaw chad rebuild --yes` ties the first two together — it auto-creates a snapshot, destroys the sandbox, recreates with the current image, and restores workspace state. Use it when changing credentials, model selection, or refreshing OpenClaw. After rebuild, run `bash scripts/chad-setup.sh chad --skip-restore` to redeploy gh auth, source clone, crons, and the L7-policy-aware chown for `/sandbox/.openclaw/{devices,workspace,identity,cron}` (required for OpenClaw 2026.4.24+).

For more granular operations, see the categorized catalog below.

## Architecture at a Glance

Chad's persistence pipeline crosses three boundaries:

## Script Catalog

### Host-side: setup & sync

| Script | What it does | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `chad-setup.sh` | One-shot host-side bootstrapper. Restores workspace from local backup or chad-state, syncs skills, deploys credentials, installs cron wrappers + `chad-shim.py`, registers cron jobs, applies network policies, clones source. | First-time setup, after major upgrades, after a sandbox rebuild. |
| `chad-sync.sh` (`npm run chad:sync`) | Single-command snapshot orchestrator: dump → backup → cron audit → summary. | Before pod resets, after meaningful changes you want durably stored, on demand. |
| `chad-clone-source.sh` | Clones `tantodefi/NemoClaw` into `/sandbox/source/` for in-sandbox read/grep access. | Auto-invoked by `chad-setup.sh`. Standalone if you need to refresh the source clone. |
| `backup-host.sh` | Snapshots `~/.nemoclaw/` (credentials, onboard session, sandbox metadata, draft policies, WIP skills) to `~/.nemoclaw/backups/host/<ts>/`. | Before re-onboarding, before destructive host operations, weekly. |
| `backup-workspace.sh` | Manual workspace download/restore via `openshell sandbox download`. Uses the same sectioned manifest as the cron-driven backup. | Cross-host migrations, manifest-gap workarounds. |
| `chad-dump-state.sh` | Generates a markdown state-dump (memory tail, ledger, sub-agent results, env). Local-only by default; `--tar` bundles raw logs. | Bug reports, before destructive ops, ad-hoc triage. |
| `chad-report-bug.sh` | Files a GitHub issue with optional state-dump attachment in the chad-state repo. | When Chad behaves wrong and you want it on record. |

### Host-side: open-webui front-end (chad-as-a-model)

| Script | What it does | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `openwebui-setup.sh` (`npm run webui:up` / `webui:up:quick`) | Brings up the open-webui container and (in tunnel mode) the Cloudflare tunnel + Access policy. | First-time setup of the chat UI. |
| `openwebui-down.sh` (`npm run webui:down`) | Stops the open-webui stack. | Maintenance windows. |
| `openwebui-chad-tunnel.sh` (`npm run webui:chad:{up,down,status,install,uninstall}`) | SSH port-forward `localhost:8901 → openshell-chad:8901` so the open-webui container can reach `chad-shim` via `host.docker.internal`. `install` registers a per-user launchd agent (`KeepAlive=true`) so the tunnel survives logout/reboot. | `up` for a one-shot session; `install` for always-on. |

### In-sandbox: backup & restore

| Script | What it does | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `chad-backup-to-github.sh` | Pushes the manifest's `[workspace]` + `[runtime]` + `[runtime-dirs]` sections plus the gbrain export to `${CHAD_STATE_REPO}`. SHA-skip optimisation avoids redundant PUTs. Also self-heals `chad-shim` if it isn't running. | Cron `workspace-backup` (every 6h). Manual via `ssh openshell-chad chad-backup-to-github`. |
| `chad-restore-from-github.sh` | Pulls `${CHAD_STATE_REPO}` and restores workspace + runtime files/dirs. Calls `chad-cron-reload` after restoring `cron/jobs.json` to re-register entries with the gateway. Also self-heals `chad-shim` if it isn't running. | Auto-invoked by `chad-setup.sh` step 4a when no local backup exists. Manual fallback after a fresh pod. |
| `chad-cron-reload` | Diffs `cron/jobs.json` against the gateway's in-memory list (`openclaw cron list --json`) and re-registers any missing entries via `openclaw cron add`. Idempotent. | Whenever cron count differs between disk and gateway. `chad-sync` flags the divergence in its audit step. |
| `chad-shim.py` | OpenAI-compat HTTP shim around `openclaw agent`. Listens on `127.0.0.1:8901` inside the sandbox; open-webui's `chad` model talks to it via the host SSH tunnel + `host.docker.internal`. Stdlib-only. v0.2+ does per-operator routing via `X-OpenWebUI-User-*` headers + `identities/<slug>.md`. | Supervised by `dev.nemoclaw.chad-shim-watchdog` launchd job (5-min cadence). Restart blocks in `chad-restore-from-github.sh` and `chad-backup-to-github.sh` also re-launch it as a backup safety net.
| `chad-webui` | OpenWebUI REST API wrapper for Chad — 60 sub-commands across 10 groups (calendar/notes/automations/memories/chats/knowledge/models/functions/tools/folders) with fail-closed per-operator API-key selection. | Driven by the `openwebui` skill and `chad-experiment` runtime; also callable directly inside agent turns. Available via MCP as `webui__*` tools. |
| `chad-webui-mcp` | MCP stdio server exposing every chad-webui sub-command as a native MCP tool (`webui__<group>_<cmd>`). | Auto-started by openclaw gateway via `mcp.servers.webui` config. |
| `chad-experiment` | Autonomous experiment lifecycle CLI (13 verbs: design, start, observe, evaluate, promote, retire, list, show, budget, ab-start, ab-pick, recent-memory, recent-ledger). Writes structured state to `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/state/experiments/`. | Driven by the `chad-experiment-night` cron + the `chad-experiment` skill. |

### Cron pipeline (auto-scheduled)

These run unattended via `openclaw cron`. Schedules and budgets live in [`scripts/task-profiles.json`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/blob/main/scripts/task-profiles.json). Every wrapper appends its result to the day's memory file (`memory/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`).

> **Cron registration flags.** Every chad-owned cron is registered with
> `--no-deliver --best-effort-deliver`. The chad sandbox's
> `messagingChannels` list is empty (no Telegram/Discord/etc bound), so
> the gateway's default delivery path returns an error per fire and gates
> the run as `failed`. Disabling delivery globally is load-bearing — the
> wrapper's stdout sentinel ("X completed") is the cron's ack, not a
> deliverable. `chad-setup.sh` registers new crons with these flags and
> patches pre-existing crons via `openclaw cron edit` on every run
> (idempotent).

| Wrapper | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `chad-email-check-cron` | `0 2,6-23 * * *` | Sweeps the inbox via `chad-mail-check`, batch-marks-read low-signal mail, parks remainder under `### Pending replies` for human review. Optionally invokes `chad-drafter` (single-turn LLM, no MCP/tools) and routes drafts through `chad-autosend-replies`. |
| `chad-issue-triage-cron` | `0 10 * * *` | Reads top-N open issues from `${CHAD_BUG_REPO}`, runs the drafter for triage decisions (skip/comment-draft/close-stale), then detaches researcher/coder sub-agents for the highest-priority items. |
| `chad-workspace-backup` | `0 */6 * * *` | Wraps `chad-backup-to-github` and detaches the slow git push so the cron payload returns in <1s. |
| `chad-gbrain-dream` | `30 3 * * *` | Nightly embed-stale + extract-graph + extract-timeline against the gbrain. Detached. Also writes `memory/dream-digest-<date>.md` (24h delta + doctor + stats) and, when doctor reports anomalies, `memory/feedback_brain_health_<date>.md` so the next self-improve sees recurring brain-health issues. |
| `chad-budget-audit` | `0 4 * * 1` | Weekly Monday: computes p95 telemetry per task vs. `task-profiles.json`, writes prose recommendations and a structured `### Proposals (machine-readable)` JSON block to `memory/feedback-proposals.md`. |
| `chad-self-improve` | `0 3 * * 0` | Weekly Sunday: reads last 7 days of subagent results, `openclaw cron runs` failures per cron, `auto-action-log.jsonl` errors, outstanding proposals; spawns researcher to draft 1–3 durable improvements under `## Self-improvement` in `feedback-proposals.md`. |
| `chad-proposal-apply` | `30 4 * * *` | Daily 04:30 UTC: closes the autonomy loop on cron telemetry. Reads the latest structured proposals JSON block from `feedback-proposals.md`, validates each entry against the safe-list (`timeoutSeconds`/`maxOutputTokens` within ±2× bounds, last-run ok, gated by `chad-action-gate chad_self_modify_cron`), applies via `openclaw cron edit`, appends an `## Applied` block. Anything riskier stays draft-only. |
| `chad-skill-watch` | `0 9 * * *` | Daily 09:00 UTC: diffs `openclaw skills list --json` against `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/state/skills-snapshot.json`, surfaces added/removed/changed skills under `## Skill catalog diff` in today's memory. Closes the gap where new gstack skills land silently and chad keeps using older patterns. |
| `chad-memory-curator` | `0 4 * * 6` | Weekly Sat 04:00 UTC: Hermes-style memory consolidation. Snapshots first via `chad-memory-snapshot`, then spawns a researcher with the curator prompt to propose lift-to-MEMORY.md, consolidate, and archive actions over recent LTM + daily memory. **Draft-only**: writes proposals to `curator-runs/<utc>/proposals.json`. Inactivity-gated (≥7d since last + ≥1h idle) and budget-guarded. |
| `chad-spawn-gc` | `30 2 * * 1` | Weekly Mon 02:30 UTC: branch retention for `chad-spawn/*` on chad-state. Default: done=7d, failed=30d, in-flight always kept. Without this, ~700 branches accrue/month at the 24-spawn/day budget. |
| `chad-experiment-night` | `0 2 * * *` | Daily 02:00 UTC: runs Chad's four-phase autonomous experiment loop (propose from memory → start designed → observe running → evaluate at window → calendar coordination). Bounded by per-operator concurrent budget + regression auto-retire threshold. See `chad-experiments.md`. |

### Inference / drafting / sending

| Wrapper | What it does | Invoked by |
|---|---|---|
| `chad-route-prompt` | Routes a prompt to the appropriate model (Nemotron 3 Super 120B default via NVIDIA free inference; premium via Anthropic when account funded). | All cron wrappers that talk to the LLM. |
| `chad-drafter` | Single-turn LLM drafter — no MCP, no tools, deterministic for cron. Drafts emails, triage decisions, etc. into the day's memory file. **Never auto-sends.** | `chad-email-check-cron`, `chad-issue-triage-cron`. |
| `chad-action-gate` | Policy + budget gate. Decides whether a queued action (auto-send, auto-comment) should run. Returns one of `auto`, `draft`, `block`, `budget`, `killed`. | `chad-autosend-replies`. |
| `chad-autosend-replies` | Routes drafter outputs through the action gate; sends `auto` immediately, leaves `draft` for human review, marks `block`/`deferred` accordingly. Mutates the drafter output in place. | Tail end of `chad-email-check-cron`. |
| `chad-mail-check` / `chad-mail-send` | Direct Proton inbox sweep / send (via `proton-tool`). | `chad-email-check-cron`, `chad-autosend-replies`. |
| `chad-premium` / `chad-premium-client` | Invokes the premium (Sonnet/Opus) path when explicitly asked or when the inbound email is from a premium-allowed sender. Requires Anthropic API key and AuthContext. | `/premium` slash command, premium-eligible cron paths. |

### Utilities

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `chad-ensure-today-memory` | Ensures `workspace/memory/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` exists, returns its path. Used by every wrapper that appends to today's memory. |
| `chad-auth-context` | Manages the AuthContext token used to elevate cron-spawned sub-agents to premium / privileged paths. |
| `chad-dump-logs` | Tarball of recent gateway/cron/sub-agent logs. See [Log Locations](log-locations.md). |
| `chad-memory-snapshot` | Pre-mutation safety net for the memory stack. Tar-gzips lancedb + wiki vault + workspace + curator-latest into `memory-snapshots/<utc>/`. `create` / `list` / `rollback` / `prune` subcommands; rollback snapshots first so it's reversible; keeps last 5. Called by `chad-memory-curator`. |
| `_chad-paths.sh` | Sourced by every wrapper. Defines `OPENCLAW_DATA`, `WORKSPACE`, `CRED_FILE`, etc. Single source of truth for filesystem paths. |
| `auto-actions.template.json` | Template `auto-actions.json` deployed when `chad-setup.sh` finds no existing one. Holds per-channel daily counters and the kill-switch. |
| `chad-state-bootstrap` | One-shot operator-host installer for the chad-state side of the gha spawn substrate. Clones `tantodefi/chad-state`, syncs `scripts/chad-state-templates/*` (the `agent-job.yml` workflow), opens a PR (or `--no-pr` for direct commit). Required only when first enabling gha-substrate kinds; not deployed into the sandbox. |

## Skill discovery and MCP wiring

`chad-setup.sh` does two registration steps that aren't obvious from the
script catalog above:

- **Skills** land in `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/skills/` (sandbox-writable,
  survives openclaw upgrades) and are registered via
  `openclaw config set skills.load.extraDirs '["/sandbox/.openclaw-data/skills"]'`.
  Without that registration, OpenClaw's `loadSkillEntries` only scans the
  managed dirs (`/sandbox/.openclaw/skills/`, `/sandbox/.agents/skills/`,
  workspace `.agents/skills/`, workspace `skills/`), skills exist on disk
  but never appear in `openclaw skills list`, the dashboard, or the
  agent's `<available_skills>` prompt block. The registration is
  idempotent — `chad-setup.sh` runs it on every invocation.
- **Gbrain MCP** is registered persistently via
  `openclaw mcp set gbrain '{"command":"gbrain","args":["serve"]}'` in
  `/sandbox/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Every `openclaw agent` session
  thereafter has `mcp_gbrain_search` / `mcp_gbrain_put_page` available
  with no per-spawn flags. The old `--mcp-server gbrain gbrain serve`
  flag was dropped from `chad-spawn.sh` — it isn't supported in
  openclaw 2026.4.x.

For the full skill catalog see [chad-skills.md](chad-skills.md). For the
autonomy loops Chad runs on top of these skills see
[chad-autonomy.md](chad-autonomy.md).

## State Locations Cheat-Sheet

When something looks wrong, the file you want is usually one of:

| Path | What's in it | Backed up? |
|---|---|---|
| `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/` | Persona prose: `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `EMAIL-POLICY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md` | ✅ `[workspace]` |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` | Daily session notes — every cron wrapper appends here | ✅ recursive |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/cron/jobs.json` | Registered cron jobs — gateway loads at startup | ✅ `[runtime]` (and `chad-cron-reload` reconciles) |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/auto-actions.json` | Action-gate state | ✅ `[runtime]` |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/exec-approvals.json` | Approved-exec list | ✅ `[runtime]` |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/queue/tasks.jsonl` | Sub-agent task ledger | ✅ `[runtime]` |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/queue/budget.json` | Token budget across cron tasks | ✅ `[runtime]` |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/agents/` | Custom agent registrations | ✅ `[runtime-dirs]` |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/identity/` | Device keypair + operator tokens | ❌ excluded (regenerable, sensitive) |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/credentials/` | Bearer token cache | ❌ excluded |
| `/sandbox/.gbrain/` | PGLite knowledge brain | ✅ via `gbrain export` → `brain/` |

See [Workspace Files §Sectioned Manifest](../workspace/workspace-files.md#sectioned-manifest) for the complete manifest format and [Backup Policy §1.2](../resources/backup-policy.md) for the rationale behind exclusions.

## Failure Modes & First Steps

| Symptom | First thing to check |
|---|---|
| Cron jobs disappeared from the OpenClaw dashboard | `ssh openshell-chad 'openclaw cron status'` — if `jobs: 0` but `cron/jobs.json` has entries, run `chad-cron-reload`. |
| Pod just got reset and Chad lost memory | `ssh openshell-chad 'chad-restore-from-github'` (auto-runs during `chad-setup.sh`). |
| Mail draft was sent without you asking | Check `auto-actions.json` and the action-gate decision log. The kill-switch is in the same file. |
| `gbrain` queries return nothing or `Aborted()` | PGLite single-process lock — confirm `gbrain serve` is running and no other process holds the lock. |
| `chad-sync` reports "cron drift" | Disk and gateway disagree. Run `ssh openshell-chad 'chad-cron-reload'`. |
| open-webui `chad` model errors / 502 | `npm run webui:chad:status` checks both the SSH tunnel and the in-sandbox shim. Tunnel down → `webui:chad:up` (or `install` for persistence). Tunnel up but `/healthz` fails → shim crashed; the next `workspace-backup` cron will self-heal it, or `ssh openshell-chad 'HOME=/sandbox nohup /usr/local/bin/chad-shim.py >/tmp/chad-shim.log 2>&1 &'`. |
| `openclaw` CLI commands fail with `gateway closed (1000): no close reason` (dashboard still works) | The gateway can't write its device-pair tmp files. Check `tail /sandbox/.openclaw-data/logs/config-audit.jsonl` for `EACCES` on `/sandbox/.openclaw/devices/*.tmp`. Re-run `bash scripts/chad-setup.sh chad --skip-restore` (step 3c chowns the writable subpaths). Permanent fix is baked into the Dockerfile — only resurfaces on sandboxes built before that change. |
| `gbrain query` returns no results / `gbrain stats` shows 0 pages | Brain is empty. Re-ingest with `ssh openshell-chad chad-ingest-fitness-books`. ~3 min for 990 chunks. If embed calls fail with `403 CONNECT tunnel failed`, the `gbrain` policy preset is missing `/usr/local/bin/bun` from its binaries allowlist — see [GBrain §L7 policy](gbrain.md#l7-policy--binary-identity). |
| `gbrain embed` fails with `Incorrect API key provided: unused` | `gbrain init` silently overwrote `config.json` to bare minimum, dropping `openai_api_key` + embed config. The wrapper now exports `OPENAI_API_KEY=unused` as fallback. Re-run `bash scripts/chad-setup.sh chad --skip-restore` — step 3b re-writes the full config after init. |
| Gateway dies (V8 OOM ~2 GB heap) and stays down | `dev.nemoclaw.chad-gateway-watchdog` launchd job on the host checks the gateway port every 5 min and relaunches with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` if it's not listening. Inspect with `tail /Users/r/.nemoclaw/openwebui/chad-gateway-watchdog.log`. The respawned gateway also exports `PATH=/sandbox/.openclaw-data/bin:…` and `CHAD_BUDGET_FILE=/sandbox/.openclaw-data/budget.json` for child processes. |
| Cron job calls a `chad-*` wrapper that crashes / silently no-ops | One of the five tracked wrapper bugs in [`wrapper-bugs.md`](wrapper-bugs.md). Sandbox-writable patched copies live at `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/bin/chad-{budget,issue-triage,issue-triage-cron,mail-check,email-check-cron}` and are persisted by the workspace backup. Cron payloads are pointed at them via absolute path (the openclaw runtime currently appends `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/bin` to PATH instead of prepending, so PATH-based shadowing alone doesn't take). |

- [Backup Policy](../resources/backup-policy.md) — full inventory across all four state layers
- [Open WebUI Front-End](openwebui.md) — chat UI exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel + Access
- [Workflow Scenarios](chad-workflows.md) — named email scenarios + regression spec
- [Log Locations](log-locations.md) — where each log stream lives
- [Chad Autonomy Loops](chad-autonomy.md) — the five self-driving loops, two known gaps, and recommended next wrappers
- [Chad Skills Catalog](chad-skills.md) — all 48 registered skills grouped by source
- [Wrapper Bugs](wrapper-bugs.md) — five tracked argv-vs-env / path bugs in `/usr/local/bin/chad-*` with shim-and-repoint workarounds in place
- [Autonomous Experiment Lifecycle](chad-experiments.md) — Chad's nightly propose → design → start → observe → evaluate → promote/retire loop with full autonomy + retire-on-regression. New `chad-experiment` CLI + `experiment-night` cron + sibling skill at `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/skills/chad-experiment/`

## Host-side watchdogs (no agent overhead)

Three launchd jobs supervise pod-side services from the host. Each fires every 5 min, takes SSH-quick action, and writes nothing to OpenWebUI's UI:

| Plist | What it supervises | Recovery action | Event sink |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev.nemoclaw.chad-gateway-watchdog` | `openclaw gateway run` on port 18789 | pkill + relaunch with 4 GB heap, `PATH=/sandbox/.openclaw-data/bin:…`, `CHAD_BUDGET_FILE=…` | `~/.nemoclaw/openwebui/chad-gateway-watchdog.log` |
| `dev.nemoclaw.chad-shim-watchdog` | `chad-shim.py` on port 8901 (the `chad` model bridge) | pkill stale + relaunch from sandbox-writable copy with `HOME=/sandbox nohup` | `~/.nemoclaw/openwebui/chad-shim-watchdog.log` + agent-inbox |
| `dev.nemoclaw.chad-spawn-poll` | Runs `chad-spawn-poll` every 5 min instead of via an agent-turn cron | Reconciles GHA-async sub-agents and writes state changes to the inbox | `~/.nemoclaw/openwebui/chad-spawn-poll-watchdog.log` + agent-inbox |

Why launchd and not openclaw cron: the openclaw `spawn-poll` cron was costing ~12.7M tokens/day and 288 UI entries/day to invoke what is structurally a 5-second shell script that needs zero LLM reasoning. Moving it to launchd reclaimed those budgets entirely; the only cost is that polls don't run when the host laptop is off (acceptable for spawn reconciliation, which is dev-session driven).

### The agent-inbox pattern

Host-side watchdogs that detect state changes append a structured event line to `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/state/agent-inbox.jsonl`. Schema:

```jsonc
{
  "ts": "2026-05-14T18:21:32Z",
  "source": "chad-spawn-poll-watchdog",   // watchdog identifier
  "kind": "spawn-reconciled",              // semantic event type
  "severity": "info|warning|error",
  "data": { /* per-source structured payload */ }
}
```

Cron agent turns (`mail-check`, `issue-triage`, `experiment-night`, etc.) can read this file at startup with `tail -n N /sandbox/.openclaw-data/state/agent-inbox.jsonl` to surface anything important that happened between turns. The file is backed up under `state/agent-inbox.jsonl` in `chad-workspace-files.txt` so pod rebuilds preserve it.

**Quiet ticks leave no trace** — watchdogs only write to the inbox when there's a real state change (reconciliation, restart, error). The local watchdog log captures every fire for ops visibility.
