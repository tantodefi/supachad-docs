# GBrain in NemoClaw

[`gbrain`](https://github.com/tantodefi/gbrain) is the knowledge store the chad
sandbox uses for hybrid (vector + graph) recall. It runs entirely inside the
sandbox: a [PGLite](https://pglite.dev/) WASM Postgres holds pages, chunks, and
embeddings, and an external embedder is called over HTTPS to vectorize content
on `gbrain put`.

NemoClaw ships a small vendored overlay (see
`scripts/gbrain-patches/`) so the same gbrain binary can target NVIDIA NIM
embeddings instead of the upstream OpenAI default. With no env vars set the
overlay is a no-op — upstream behavior is preserved.

## Architecture

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┘
                                                           ▼
                                              integrate.api.nvidia.com
                                              /v1/embeddings
                                              (nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2)
```

Three pieces are NemoClaw-specific:

1. **`scripts/gbrain-patches/`** — overlay applied in the Dockerfile after `bun add`. Makes the embedder model + dimensions + input_type configurable via env vars (upstream hardcodes `text-embedding-3-large` @ 1536 dims). See `scripts/gbrain-patches/README.md` for the full diff and sync-with-upstream procedure.
2. **`scripts/sandbox-bin/gbrain-wrapper.sh`** — wrapper installed at `/usr/local/bin/gbrain`. Reads `/sandbox/.gbrain/config.json`, exports the relevant env vars (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GBRAIN_EMBED_*`), then `exec`s the real `gbrain-bin`. The OpenAI SDK inside gbrain auto-picks-up `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. **`scripts/chad-cron-wrappers/chad-gbrain-dream`** + `chad-log-event` — daily maintenance + structured event log that the cron prompts call. See [Memory workflow](#memory-workflow) below.

## Embedder env-var contract

The patched gbrain reads these at module load. Defaults reproduce upstream behavior.

| Env var | Config field (`config.json`) | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `openai_base_url` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Endpoint. Set to `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` for NIM. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai_api_key` | wrapper falls back to `unused` | OpenAI SDK refuses to construct without it, even when the endpoint doesn't auth. |
| `GBRAIN_EMBED_MODEL` | `embed_model` | `text-embedding-3-large` | NIM model id. We use `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2`. |
| `GBRAIN_EMBED_DIMENSIONS` | `embed_dimensions` | `1536` | Must match what the model returns. **Schema column is sized at `gbrain init` time** — changing this post-init requires a fresh brain. |
| `GBRAIN_EMBED_INPUT_TYPE` | `embed_input_type` | (unset) | NIM-only. `passage` for indexing, `query` for retrieval. We set `passage`; gbrain's embed signature doesn't yet distinguish. |
| `GBRAIN_EMBED_PASS_DIMENSIONS` | (none) | `true` | Set `false` for fixed-dim NIM models that reject the `dimensions` param. |

The default NemoClaw setup configures NVIDIA NIM with `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2` at 1024 dimensions — see `scripts/chad-setup.sh` step 3b.

## Sandbox layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/sandbox/.gbrain/config.json` | Embedder config (mode 0600). Wrapper reads this. |
| `/sandbox/.gbrain/brain.pglite/` | PGLite data dir (pages, chunks, embeddings, links, timeline). |
| `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` | Daily journals (`<date>.md`) + structured event logs (`events-<date>.jsonl`). Source of truth that `chad-gbrain-dream` ingests. |
| `/usr/local/bin/gbrain` | Wrapper script. |
| `/usr/local/bin/gbrain-bin` | Real binary (bun-built). |
| `/usr/local/lib/gbrain/node_modules/gbrain/src/core/embedding.ts` | Patched at image build via Dockerfile overlay. |
| `/usr/local/lib/gbrain/node_modules/gbrain/src/core/pglite-schema.ts` | Same — patched at image build. |

## Memory workflow

NemoClaw uses three layers, following the gbrain "brain vs memory vs session"
guidance (`/Users/r/gbrain/docs/guides/brain-vs-memory.md`):

| Layer | Where | Lifetime | What it holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **World** | gbrain pages | persistent | Textbooks, references, slugged docs (`memory/<date>`, `events/<date>`, `system/*`). Searched first. |
| **Operations** | `<workspace>/memory/<date>.md` + `events-<date>.jsonl` | rolling | Today's human journal and structured event log. Cron wrappers append here. |
| **Session** | conversation context | ephemeral | The current chat. |

### Daily files

- `<date>.md` — human-readable journal. Sections: `# <date>`, `## Events`, plus narrative additions.
- `events-<date>.jsonl` — one JSON object per line: `{ts, kind, source, summary, ref?}`.

Both are written by `chad-log-event`:

```bash
chad-log-event mail-in chad-mail-check \
  "tjcooke@protonmail.com: Squat depth question" \
  "msg-id:abc123"
```

Args: `<kind> <source> <summary> [ref]`. Quote the summary. Common kinds: `mail-in`, `mail-sent`, `draft`, `action`, `error`, `cron`.

### Daily ingest cycle (`chad-gbrain-dream`)

Runs from cron (see `scripts/chad-cron-wrappers/chad-gbrain-dream`). In a single
~60s window it:

1. Ensures today's memory file exists.
2. In parallel: `gbrain put system/<doc>` for each workspace doc (SOUL, USER, AGENTS, MEMORY, HEARTBEAT, TOOLS, EMAIL-POLICY, IDENTITY).
3. In parallel: `gbrain put memory/<date>` (the human journal) and `gbrain put events/<date>` (the JSONL stream).
4. `gbrain extract timeline --source db` — pulls dated events into the timeline graph.
5. `gbrain doctor` — health check.
6. Detaches the slow steps (`gbrain embed --stale`, `gbrain extract links`) via `nohup`. They finish in the background and the next dream cycle picks up wherever they left off.
7. Appends a `## Brain maintenance` block to today's `.md` summarizing what ran.

The detach pattern is required because `extract links` is LLM-driven and can
take minutes. The cron prompt only needs the synchronous portion to return
"completed" before the embedded model's exec tool times out.

## Common operations

### Inspect

```bash
gbrain stats                   # page / chunk / embedding counts
gbrain doctor                  # config + connectivity + schema check
gbrain query "<question>"      # hybrid search
gbrain get memory/2026-04-29   # read one page
gbrain list pages              # paginated page listing
```

### Add / update content

```bash
gbrain put system/notes --content "$(cat my-notes.md)"
gbrain put memory/2026-04-29 --content "$(cat /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-04-29.md)"
```

`gbrain put` upserts by slug. The wrapper handles env-var setup automatically.

### Verify embedder

```bash
gbrain doctor
# look for: "embedder: ok (model=nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2, dim=1024)"
```

If `doctor` reports an embedder error, the most common causes are: bad
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, wrong model id (model removed from gateway), dim mismatch
between `GBRAIN_EMBED_DIMENSIONS` and the schema (vector column is fixed at
init time), or the L7 binary allowlist not including `bun` (see below).

### L7 policy / binary identity

The OpenShell L7 proxy pins egress allowlist by `/proc/self/exe`. The
`gbrain` command on `$PATH` is a shell wrapper that execs
`/usr/local/bin/gbrain-bin`, which itself execs
`bun /…/cli.ts`. The TLS dial to NVIDIA NIM happens from the **bun**
process — not from `gbrain` or `gbrain-bin`. The `gbrain.yaml` policy
preset's `binaries:` list must include all three paths:

```yaml
binaries:
  - { path: /usr/local/bin/gbrain }
  - { path: /usr/local/bin/gbrain-bin }
  - { path: /usr/local/bin/bun }
```

Symptom when `bun` is missing from the allowlist: `curl: (56) CONNECT
tunnel failed, response 403` on every embed call. Confirm by tailing
`/sandbox/.openclaw-data/logs/config-audit.jsonl` (or running
`gbrain embed --stale` and watching the error). Same lesson as the
`feedback_openshell_l7_binary_identity` rule — wrapper paths must always
include the wrapped binary.

## Recovery: corrupt or wrong-dim brain

If the schema vector dim no longer matches the embedder (e.g. you changed
`GBRAIN_EMBED_DIMENSIONS` after init), `gbrain put` will silently store pages
with zero chunks. Recover by reinitializing:

```bash
# Inside the sandbox (or via kubectl exec as root):
mv /sandbox/.gbrain/brain.pglite /sandbox/.gbrain/brain.pglite.broken-$(date -u +%FT%TZ)
rm -f /sandbox/.gbrain/postmaster.pid /sandbox/.gbrain/.gbrain-lock

HOME=/sandbox \
  GBRAIN_EMBED_MODEL=nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2 \
  GBRAIN_EMBED_DIMENSIONS=1024 \
  gbrain init

# CRITICAL: gbrain init silently overwrites config.json to bare minimum
# ({"engine": ..., "database_path": ...}). The wrapper relies on
# openai_api_key + embed_* fields being present, so re-write the config
# AFTER every init or the next call goes out as `OPENAI_API_KEY=unused`
# and gets a 401.
cat > /sandbox/.gbrain/config.json <<'JSON'
{
  "engine": "pglite",
  "database_path": "/sandbox/.gbrain/brain.pglite",
  "openai_api_key": "<NIM key>",
  "openai_base_url": "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
  "embed_model": "nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2",
  "embed_dimensions": "1024",
  "embed_input_type": "passage"
}
JSON
chmod 0600 /sandbox/.gbrain/config.json
```

Then re-import. A full 990-chunk fitness-books ingest takes ~3 min against
NVIDIA NIM (verified 2026-05-02). Verify the round-trip with:

```bash
ssh openshell-chad 'gbrain stats'
# Pages: 990  Chunks: 991  Embedded: 991   ← embedded == chunks means OK
ssh openshell-chad 'gbrain query "supple leopard hip mobility"'
# expect 0.65+ similarity hits returned within 1s
ssh openshell-chad 'gbrain doctor 2>&1 | grep embeddings'
# [OK] embeddings: 100% coverage, 0 missing
```

The canonical entry point for re-ingesting fitness reference content is
`/usr/local/bin/chad-ingest-fitness-books` (deployed by `chad-setup.sh`).
That script downloads OCR text from archive.org and chunks it into
~1500-char pages tagged `fitness, starting-strength, book-chunk` or
`fitness, supple-leopard, book-chunk`.

## Why we patched

`gbrain` v0.14.x hardcodes `text-embedding-3-large` at 1536 dimensions in two
files (`src/core/embedding.ts`, `src/core/pglite-schema.ts`); the
`embed_model` field in `config.json` is read on save but never on use. NVIDIA
NIM doesn't serve `text-embedding-3-large`, and its embed-qa models return
1024 / 2048 dims. Without the patch, gbrain cannot talk to NIM at all.

The overlay is two files copied over the upstream sources after `bun add`
runs. With no env vars set, behavior is identical to upstream. When upstream
gains native config-driven embedder support, **delete the overlay** —
`scripts/gbrain-patches/README.md` covers the sync-with-upstream procedure.
