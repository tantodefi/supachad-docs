# Chad Orchestrator

This is the skill Chad uses to act as an *agent orchestrator* rather than a
single agent. It wraps five baked-in helpers that implement a canonical
sub-agent contract, a task queue, a token budget, and a memory merge path.

## The Sub-Agent Contract

Every sub-agent, regardless of kind, is invoked with the same shape:

```bash
chad-spawn \
  --kind coder \
  --task-file /tmp/task-<id>.json \
  [--workdir /sandbox/.openclaw-data/subagents/<id>] \
  [--result-file /sandbox/.openclaw-data/subagents/<id>/result.json] \
  [--timeout 600] \
  [--budget-tokens 50000] \
  [--dry-run]
```

The helper resolves the kind manifest under `kinds/<kind>.yaml`, validates
the budget against `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/budget.json`, writes a `queued`
entry to `queue/tasks.jsonl`, runs the sub-agent binary with the task as
its prompt, collects `stdout` + `stderr` into the workdir, and on exit
writes a structured `result.json`.

Kinds currently supported:

| Kind | Binary | Policy preset | Brain? | GStack? | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `brain` | `gbrain` | *(none — local PGLite)* | native | — | Query/store knowledge brain; free (no inference unless needed) |
| `coder` | `/usr/local/bin/pi` | `pi-agent` | brain-first | `/gstack-qa`, `/gstack-ship` | Write/refactor code, run build + tests |
| `researcher` | `/usr/local/bin/claude` | `subagent-researcher` | brain-first | — | Web/gh search, collect facts, produce a report |
| `writer` | `/usr/local/bin/claude` | `subagent-writer` | brain context | `/gstack-ceo`, `/gstack-ship` | Draft email replies, docs, comments |
| `reviewer` | `/usr/local/bin/claude` | `subagent-reviewer` | brain context | `/gstack-review` | Audit a diff, run checklist against code |
| `fitness` | `/usr/local/bin/claude` | `subagent-researcher` | brain-first | — | Strength/mobility questions from Starting Strength + Supple Leopard |

Adding a new kind is one YAML file under `kinds/` plus (optionally) one
network policy preset under `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/presets/`.

## GBrain Integration

All `openclaw-agent` kinds (`researcher`, `writer`, `reviewer`) inherit
the gbrain MCP server because it is registered persistently in the
sandbox's `openclaw.json` by `chad-setup.sh`:

```bash
openclaw mcp set gbrain '{"command":"gbrain","args":["serve"]}'
```

Every `openclaw agent` invocation thereafter has the gbrain MCP tools
(`mcp_gbrain_search`, `mcp_gbrain_put_page`, …) available with no
spawn-time flags required. `chad-spawn` now invokes:

```bash
env HOME=/sandbox \
  openclaw agent --agent main --timeout "${timeout_secs}" \
    --session-id "sub-<id>" \
    -m "<prompt>"
```

The `--mcp-server` flag is **not** supported in openclaw 2026.4.x —
gbrain lives in `openclaw.json` instead, and `--local` was dropped at
the same time. The `brain` kind uses the gbrain CLI directly (no
inference required for pure recall tasks).

**Brain-first rule**: `researcher`, `coder`, and `reviewer` prompts all
instruct the sub-agent to run `gbrain query` *before* any external API
call. Findings are stored back with `gbrain put-page` so the next spawn
doesn't pay the same research cost twice.

## GStack Workflow Skills

The full canonical 40-skill gstack OpenClaw-adapter bundle is synced by
`chad-setup.sh` into `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/skills/` (chosen because
that path is sandbox-writable and survives openclaw upgrades). The same
script registers that directory as `skills.load.extraDirs` in
`openclaw.json` so the dashboard, CLI listing, and agent's
`<available_skills>` prompt block all see them. Skill names use the
canonical `gstack-<verb>` shape (e.g. `gstack-investigate`,
`gstack-qa`, `gstack-ship`, `gstack-review`, `gstack-ceo-review`,
`gstack-retro`, `gstack-cso`, `gstack-canary`, …) — the legacy
`gstack-openclaw-*` 4-skill subset is pruned on every sync.

Sub-agent prompts mention the most relevant skill but leave the choice
to the agent:

| Kind | Relevant skills |
|---|---|
| `reviewer` | `/gstack-review` — structured role-based review (CEO/QA/security) |
| `writer` | `/gstack-ceo-review`, `/gstack-ship` — for long-form docs or release notes |
| `coder` | `/gstack-qa`, `/gstack-ship` — QA checklist + ship readiness |

**When to skip gstack**: Quick patches, one-line email replies, and PR
descriptions under 50 lines don't need gstack overhead. The prompt
templates say "optional" and leave the call to the agent's judgment.

For the full 40-skill catalog see
[docs/operations/chad-skills.md](../../../docs/operations/chad-skills.md).

## Fan-Out Pattern (Multiple Similar Items)

When the user asks for N similar outputs (N articles, N reports, N drafts),
**spawn one agent per item** — never cram all N into a single task.

```bash
# Correct: 4 writer spawns, one per article
for topic in "community" "barbell" "micros-macros" "habits"; do
  chad-spawn --kind writer --task-file /tmp/task-${topic}.json
done

# Wrong: one writer with "write 4 articles" — times out after #1
```

Run `chad-collect --today` after each spawn so the result is checkpointed
in daily memory before the next spawn starts.

## Partial-Completion Recovery

If a spawn batch is interrupted (timeout, crash, budget):

1. Run `chad-collect --today` to flush completed results into memory.
2. Write remaining tasks to `HEARTBEAT.md` so the next heartbeat picks up:

```markdown
## Pending spawns (resume next heartbeat)
- [ ] writer: "Barbell Strength Training article" → /tmp/article-barbell.md
- [ ] writer: "Micros vs Macros article"          → /tmp/article-micros.md
- [ ] writer: "Habits article"                     → /tmp/article-habits.md
- [ ] After all done: reply-mail --id=<MSGID> with all articles
```

3. Do **not** ask the user what to do. The instruction is still valid —
   save the checkpoint and continue on the next heartbeat.

## When To Use This Skill

- A bug intake task breaks down into >1 concrete sub-tasks and Chad wants
  to run the coding one in parallel with the research one.
- A long email response needs research from the web and a draft reply —
  route research to `researcher`, drafting to `writer`, and have Chad
  integrate both results.
- A PR review needs both a security checklist and a build check — spawn
  a `reviewer` + a `coder` against the same PR and merge results.

## Directory Layout

```text
/sandbox/.openclaw-data/
├── subagents/
│   ├── <task-id-1>/
│   │   ├── task.json         # input
│   │   ├── prompt.txt        # rendered prompt for the sub-agent binary
│   │   ├── stdout.log        # sub-agent stdout (streamed)
│   │   ├── stderr.log        # sub-agent stderr (streamed)
│   │   └── result.json       # structured output (written on exit)
│   └── <task-id-2>/…
├── queue/
│   └── tasks.jsonl           # append-only ledger (queued → running → done|failed)
└── budget.json               # daily token budget with UTC reset
```

All of `subagents/`, `queue/`, and `budget.json` are included in the
`chad-backup-to-github` backup set — so the sub-agent ledger survives
sandbox resets alongside memory.

## Canonical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Classify a task (optional — Chad can pick the kind directly).
kind="$(chad-route --task-file /tmp/task.json)"     # echoes: coder|researcher|writer|reviewer|fitness|codex|opencode

# 2. Spawn.
task_id="$(chad-spawn --kind "$kind" --task-file /tmp/task.json)"

# 3. Wait or poll.
chad-spawn-status --id "$task_id"     # prints queued|running|done|failed

# 4. Collect results into today's memory.
chad-collect --today                   # scans recent subagents/, appends "## Dispatched Tasks"
```

Chad can also run the intake helper which does all four steps in sequence:

```bash
chad-intake --from chat --task-file /tmp/task.json
# or:
chad-intake --from proton --message-id MSGID
```

### Substrate selection (where the sub-agent runs)

Each kind has a default substrate set in its manifest. Override per
spawn when you need to:

```bash
# Force in-container execution (default for coder/researcher/writer/reviewer/fitness):
chad-spawn --kind coder --substrate local --task-file /tmp/task.json

# Force GHA runner (default for codex/opencode):
chad-spawn --kind writer --substrate gha --task-file /tmp/task.json

# Async dispatch (gha-only) — returns task_id immediately. The
# chad-spawn-poll cron (every 5min) transitions the ledger entry
# from running → done|failed when the runner commits result.json back.
chad-spawn --kind codex --async --task-file /tmp/task.json

# Per-spawn binary swap — use codex for one writer spawn. The kind's
# L7 policy preset still applies; the override binary must be on its
# allowlist or the proxy 403s.
chad-spawn --kind writer --binary-override /usr/local/bin/codex --task-file /tmp/task.json
```

Substrates:

- **`local`** — runs in Chad's container under the kind's L7 policy
  preset. Synchronous. Default for kinds whose work needs gbrain,
  embedded Nemotron, or `/sandbox/source` access.
- **`gha`** — runs on a GitHub Actions runner via `tantodefi/chad-state`
  (popebot-style branch-as-job-record). Runner installs the binary on
  demand, picks provider by available secret (NVIDIA fallback when
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` absent), commits result back. Loses L7 enforcement;
  gains real per-spawn isolation. Default for codex / opencode.

See `docs/design/spawn-as-github-run.md` for the full architecture.

## Dry-Run Mode

Before trusting a spawn to burn real tokens, `--dry-run` writes a fake
`result.json` with `{"dry_run": true, "would_invoke": "<binary> <args>"}`.
Safe for validating the queue shape, memory merge, and budget math
without hitting any inference endpoint.

```bash
chad-spawn --kind coder --task-file /tmp/task.json --dry-run
```

## Budget Protection

Every spawn decrements `/sandbox/.openclaw-data/budget.json`:

```json
{
  "date_utc": "2026-04-08",
  "remaining_tokens": 450000,
  "daily_limit": 500000,
  "spent_by_kind": { "coder": 30000, "researcher": 20000 }
}
```

- On the first spawn of a UTC day the file is rewritten with
  `remaining_tokens = daily_limit`.
- `chad-spawn` refuses (exit 77) when `--budget-tokens` > `remaining_tokens`.
- Dry-runs don't touch the budget.
- Override with `CHAD_DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT` env var or edit the JSON directly
  for one-off tests.

This is the single most important safety net in the orchestrator: prevents
a runaway loop where Chad spawns a sub-agent that spawns a sub-agent that
spawns a sub-agent.

## Safety Rules

- **Never** let a sub-agent spawn another sub-agent without explicit
  parent approval. The budget file is advisory, not enforced at the
  kernel level — the contract is honor-based inside the sandbox.
- **Never** commit secrets into `result.json` or `stdout.log`. The
  backup pipeline pushes these files to `tantodefi/chad-state` (a
  private repo) but the same caution applies as with `memory/`.
- **Never** route a task to `coder` without reading the task file first.
  A malicious task title "fix bug" could hide a prompt-injection payload.
- **Always** run with `--dry-run` the first time a new kind is exercised,
  or after editing a `kinds/*.yaml` manifest.
- **Always** let `chad-collect` run after a spawn batch so the ledger
  converges with `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` before the next cron fire.

## Related Skills

- `chad-bug-intake` — upstream source of tasks for the orchestrator.
- `proton-calendar` — the email cron can route non-trivial replies to a
  `writer` sub-agent via `chad-intake --from proton`.
- `nemoclaw-manage-policy` — use when a new kind needs a network policy
  that doesn't exist yet.
